We will be available up until 9pm for these appointments. Most of our factories are getting back to normal, although reduced, operation & production but due to the lockdown lead times have reduced (in most cases) for delivery of customer orders. We still quote approx 8 weeks but in many cases this will now be much quicker! All of our furniture is European made in modern, safe factories who have all put distancing in place and are supporting workers who have had to isolate due to concerns of the virus but we will be checking with our other suppliers for accessories etc to make sure their factories are doing the same.</article> <li class=svelte-1bo8kf6><article class="uk-article uk-grid-collapse uk-margin" uk-grid><h3 class="svelte-1bo8kf6 uk-article-title">Government Advice</h3> <p class="svelte-1bo8kf6 date uk-article-meta">5/28/2020</p> <p>Following advice from Boris we have to hold off reopening until 15th June, we are meeting customers by appointment from 1st though so please feel free to book a time and visit our shop at leisure without having to think about keeping distance from other customers.
